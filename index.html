        <h1>Time-Accurate Speech Rich Transcription with Non-Fluencies</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Abstract. </b> Speech is a hierarchical collection of text, prosody, emotions, dysfluencies, etc. Automatic transcription of speech that goes beyond text (words) is an underexplored problem. We focus on transcribing speech along with non-fluencies (dysfluencies). The current state-of-the-art pipeline suffers from complex architecture design, training complexity, and significant shortcomings in the local sequence aligner, and it does not explore in-context learning capacity. In this work, we propose SSDM 2.0, which tackles those shortcomings via four main contributions: (1) We propose a novel neural articulatory flow to derive highly scalable speech representations. (2) We developed a full-stack connectionist subsequence aligner that captures all types of dysfluencies.(3) We introduced a mispronunciation prompt pipeline and consistency learning module into LLM to leverage dysfluency in-context pronunciation learning abilities. (4) We curated Libri-Dys and open-sourced the current largest-scale co-dysfluency corpus, Libri-Co-Dys, for future research endeavors. Overall, SSDM 2.0 outperforms SSDM and all other dysfluency transcription models by a large margin.

        <h2>nfvPPA Speech</h2>
        <p>
            People with nfvPPA gradually have more trouble expressing themselves, even though they still understand the meaning of words. They might begin speaking in shorter phrases or pausing mid-sentence or mid-word. They may have increasing difficulty with pronouncing or mixing up sounds in familiar words.
